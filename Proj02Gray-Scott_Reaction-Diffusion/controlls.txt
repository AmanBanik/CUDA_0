--- MOUSE CONTROLS ---

[ SCROLL WHEEL ]       : ZOOM IN / OUT
                         - Zooms into the simulation grid centered on the screen.
                         - Range: 0.1x (Wide view) to 50.0x (Microscopic view).

[ RIGHT CLICK + DRAG ] : PAN CAMERA
                         - Move the view around the infinite canvas.
                         - Works seamlessly while zoomed in.

[ LEFT CLICK ]         : PAINT / INJECT
                         - Injects Chemical V into the simulation at the cursor.
                         - Use this to disrupt stable patterns, cut through "coral,"
                           or create new growth centers.
                         - The brush size scales dynamically with zoom.


--- KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS ---

[ R ]                  : RESET SIMULATION
                         - Wipes the grid and generates a new randomized "noise seed"
                           in the center. Use this if the pattern dies out or
                           stabilizes into a solid color.

[ S ]                  : SAVE SNAPSHOT
                         - Instantly saves the current view (including zoom/pan)
                           as a high-resolution PNG in the 'snapshots/' folder.

[ ESC ]                : QUIT
                         - Closes the window and exits the program safely.
